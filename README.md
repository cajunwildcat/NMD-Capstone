# Overview

The objective of this project is to create an experience that involves projection mapping and depth sensory through the Xbox One Kinect. The primary programming language is in C# and the script engine is Unity. By mapping a scene into the real world, we create an interactive environment where users are picked up by the Kinect, and then given a marker that determines their position in relation to the scene in Unity (hence, projection mapping).

The images will appear and have various animations depending on the New Media Designer.
